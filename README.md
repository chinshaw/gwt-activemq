gwt-activemq
============

Note: This is not an activemq messaging service but a service to manage your activemq service via a rest api. 

This is a work in progress but the initial pieces are in place to make activemq management calls to a jolokia enabled service. 

Right now it only supports 1 method for fetching queues but in the future it will support all the supported jmx methods.


It also relies on the gwt-jolokia plugin in my list of projects.

More to come shortly.
